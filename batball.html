        <h1>What makes Jasprit Bumrah so special?</h1>

                Jasprit Bumrah has it on a string. In Antigua, the first Test of India’s 2019 tour of West Indies, India’s premier bowler had the inswinger on point to the left handers. Just days later in Jamaica, he had the ball going the other way, with minimal change in action or body position.

                Like Antigua, he’s too good for the West Indies batsmen. Poor John Campbell and Darren Bravo are caught behind the wicket having not done too much wrong. After Bravo is dismissed, it is pure chaos. The ball cannons into both Shamarh Brooks and Roston Chase’s front pads. Most, including Bumrah, thought the hat-trick ball to Chase was heading down the legside. However, Virat Kohli decided to review with great effect, with Bumrah becoming the third Indian to take a Test hat-trick. In just his 12th Test.
