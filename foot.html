        <h1>STALWART COACHING-- HOW TO BE BRAVE AS A BASKETBALL COACH</h1>
        <hr>

            <p>
                A stalwart basketball coach is brave in his or her mind and also brave with his or her words.<br> A stalwart coach is a loyal coach and never throws players under the proverbial bus of critique or blame. A stalwart coach is a self-disciplined coach who always reframes the deficits into opportunities.

                When you are learning to ride a motorcycle, you have to look past the turn in the road. Focusing on the turn will cause you to crash.<br> Looking past the curve keeps your focus on where you want to go. The same is true in coaching.
